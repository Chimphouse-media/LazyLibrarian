To help with identifying and fixing issues, please include as much information as possible, including:
### LazyLibrarian version number (at the bottom of config page)
### Operating system used (windows, mac, linux, NAS type)
### Interface in use (default, bookstrap)
### Which api (Goodreads, GoogleBooks, both)
### Source of your LazyLibrarian installation (git, zip file, 3rd party package)
### Relevant debug log with api keys and any passwords redacted

Please note - usually a single line of log is not sufficient. The lines just before the error occurs can give useful context and greatly assist with debugging.

### There is a built-in debug log creator on the logs page which makes it easy to provide this information
* To use it, first go to the log page and make sure debug logging is OFF
* NowÂ press the "Start debug log" button
* Go and do whatever you need to recreate the error
* Go back to the log page and press "Save debug log"
* You can now turn debug logging off again if you want
* The saved log file will be found in your lazylibrarian log directory called debug.zip
* It will contain all lines logged since you pressed "Start debug log" with any passwords and api keys removed
* Attach the zip file to your bug report.
